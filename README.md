# scenic-oracle_adapter

An Oracle adapter for Thoughtbot's [scenic](https://github.com/thoughtbot/scenic) rubygem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scenic-oracle_adapter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

You'll need to tell the scenic gem to use this adapter in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/scenic.rb

Scenic.configure do |config|
  config.database = Scenic::Adapters::Oracle.new
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/test` (or `rspec`) to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

By default, the test suite will attempt to connect to a local XE instance (see `spec/spec_helper.rb` for connection details).
You can override the database URL by supplying a value to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

If you don't have a test Oracle database available, you can use [oracle-dev-box](https://github.com/cdinger/oracle-dev-box) to
run an XE instance in Vagrant.
